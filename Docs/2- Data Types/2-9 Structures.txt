1. Introduction to Structures:
    * A structure is a collection of variables of different data types grouped together under a single name.
    * Each element inside the structure is called a "member" and can be accessed individually using the dot (.) operator.
    * Syntax Example:
        > struct {
            <list of variables>;
        } struct_name;

2. Unpacked Structures:
    * Structures are unpacked by default.
    * Each member is stored independently (not bit-packed).
    * Members can be of any type, including arrays and other structures.
    * Unpacked structures are useful for grouping data of mixed types logically.

3. Typedef Structures:
    * Typedef allows creating a user-defined data type for a structure.
    * Useful when you need to declare multiple variables with the same structure definition.
    * Once typedef is used, the structure can be declared like any other data type.
    * Syntax Example:
        > typedef struct {
            <list of variables>;
        } type_name;

4. Packed Structures:
    * A packed structure stores all members contiguously in memory (bit-wise packed).
    * All members must be of fixed-size data types (bit, logic, reg, etc.).
    * The first member is the most significant, and the following members are arranged in decreasing order of significance.
    * A packed structure behaves like a single bit vector, allowing bit-level operations.
    * Syntax Example:
        > typedef struct packed {
            bit [3:0] mode;
            bit [2:0] cfg;
            bit       en;
        } st_ctrl;

5. Array of Structures:
    * An array of structures can be created using any array type:
        . Fixed array
        . Dynamic array
        . Associative array
