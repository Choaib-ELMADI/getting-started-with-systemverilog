1. Introduction to Typedef:
    * "typedef" can be used to create a new name (alias) for an existing data type.
    * It simplifies long or repetitive type declarations.
    * It helps improve code readability and maintainability.
    * Syntax Example:
        > typedef existing_type new_type_name;

2. Typedef with Structures and Enums:
    * "typedef" can also be used to name structures or enumerations for reuse.
    * Syntax Examples:
        > typedef enum { IDLE, RUN, STOP } state_t;
        > typedef struct {
            int       id;
            bit [7:0] value;
        } packet_t;

3. Introduction to Alias:
    * "alias" provides a new name (reference) to an existing variable, signal, or net.
    * Both names point to the same storage — updating one updates the other.
    * It improves readability and reduces redundancy in hierarchical connections.
    * Syntax Example:
        > alias new_name = existing_name;

4. Key Differences:
    * "typedef" creates a new type name — used at compile time.
    * "alias" creates a new name for an existing variable — used at runtime.
