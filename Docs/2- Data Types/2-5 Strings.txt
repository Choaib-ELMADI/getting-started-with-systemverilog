1. SystemVerilog String:
    * The "string" data type is an ordered collection of characters.
    * The length of a string can change dynamically during simulation.
    * Syntax Example:
        > string variable_name [= initial_value];

2. Strings in Verilog:
    * Each ASCII character requires 8 bits (1 byte).
    * Strings in Verilog are stored as packed arrays of bytes.
    * Extra bits are padded with zeros if the string is shorter.
    * If the string is too long, it is truncated from the most significant bits.
    * Syntax Example:
        > reg [16*8-1:0] my_string;         // 16 characters
        > my_string = "How are you";        // fits
        > my_string = "How are you doing?"; // truncated

3. String Operators:
    * Strings can be compared, concatenated, and indexed.
    * Common operations include:
        . Indexing:      Str[index]
        . Equality:      Str1 == Str2
        . Inequality:    Str1 != Str2
        . Comparison:    Str1 < Str2, ...
        . Replication:   {N{Str}}
        . Method call:   Str.method(arguments)
        . Concatenation: {Str1, Str2, ..., StrN}

4. Basic String Methods:
    * len():        Returns the number of characters in the string.
    * putc(i, c):   Replaces the character at index "i" with "c".
    * getc(i):      Returns the ASCII code of the character at index "i".
    * tolower():    Converts all characters to lowercase.
    * compare(s):   Compares two strings (like strcmp in C).
    * icompare(s):  Case-insensitive comparison.
    * substr(i, j): Returns a substring from index "i" to "j".
    * String conversion methods...
