1. Overview:
    * Interprocess communication allows multiple processes in a testbench to synchronize, share data, or control resource access.
    * SystemVerilog provides three main mechanisms for this: "events", "semaphores", and "mailboxes".

2. Events:
    * Events are used for "synchronization" between threads.
    * One process triggers the event, and another waits for it:
        . Creation   : event eventA;
        . Triggering : ->eventA;
        . Waiting    : @eventA; "or" wait(eventA.triggered);

3. Semaphores:
    * Semaphores manage "mutual exclusion" (mutex) for shared resources, similar to locks in software programming.
    * Created with "semaphore key = new(N);" where "N" is the number of keys.

    * Blocking and Non-blocking Methods:
        . get(n): Blocking method; waits until n tokens are available.
        . try_get(n): Non-blocking method; returns immediately if n tokens are unavailable.
        . put(n): Releases n tokens back to the semaphore.

4. Mailboxes:
    * Mailboxes provide a "data-passing mechanism" between threads or components.
    * Commonly used in testbenches to transfer data between generators, drivers, monitors, and scoreboards safely.
    * Operates as a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer, messages are sent and received in order.
    * Supports thread synchronization, the receiver waits if the mailbox is empty.

    * Blocking and Non-blocking Methods:
        . put(): Puts a message into the mailbox.
        . get(): Blocking method; waits until a message is available.
        . try_get(): Non-blocking method; returns immediately if no message is available.
        . num(): Returns the number of messages currently stored in the mailbox.

    * Syntax Examples:
        > mailbox gen2drv;      // mailbox between generator and driver
        > gen2drv.put(trans);   // put transaction into mailbox
        > gen2drv.get(trans);   // blocking get() call
