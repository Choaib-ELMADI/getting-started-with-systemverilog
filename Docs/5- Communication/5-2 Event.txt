1. SystemVerilog Events:
    * Events are static object handles used to synchronize between two or more concurrently active processes.
    * One process triggers the event, while another waits for it.
    * They can be assigned, compared, or even set to "null".
    * When one event variable is assigned to another, both refer to the same synchronization object.
    * Events can be passed to queues, functions, or tasks.
    * Syntax Examples:
        > event over;               // new event created
        > event over_again = over;  // alias to "over"
        > event empty = null;       // event variable with no object

2. Triggering and Waiting for Events:
    * Events can be triggered using the "->" or "->>" operator.
    * Processes can wait for an event using "@" or the ".triggered" property.

3. Difference Between '@' and '.triggered':
    * "@event_a" waits for the next event trigger only.
    * ".triggered" ensures the process unblocks even if trigger and wait happen simultaneously.
    * Using ".triggered" avoids race conditions between triggering and waiting.

4. 'wait_order':
    * The "wait_order" statement waits for a sequence of events to occur in a specific order.
    * If any event is triggered out of order, an error message is issued.
    * Syntax Example:
        > wait_order(a, b, c)
        >   $display("");
        > else
        >   $display("");

5. Merging Events:
    * When one event variable is assigned to another, both become linked.
    * Any process waiting on either event will resume when the shared event is triggered.
