1. Classes:
    * Classes in SystemVerilog are user-defined data types that combine both data and the subroutines (functions or tasks) that operate on that data.
    * They enable object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation and dynamic object creation.
    * The data within a class are called "properties", and the subroutines are called "methods".
    * Objects of a class are created dynamically at run-time using a handle (similar to a pointer).
    * If an object is not created, its handle has the default value "null".
    * Classes are declared using the "class" and "endclass" keywords.

    * Constructors:
        . A constructor is a special method named "new" that is automatically called when an object is created.
        . It is used to initialize class properties during object creation.
        . If no constructor is defined, SystemVerilog provides a default empty one.
        . Constructors can also take arguments to set initial values.

    * Syntax example:
        > class class_name;
        >   // Properties
        >   // Methods
        > endclass // class_name
