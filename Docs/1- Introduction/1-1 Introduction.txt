1. What is SystemVerilog:
    * SystemVerilog is an extension of Verilog that adds powerful verification features and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
    * It allows engineers to verify designs using complex testbench structures and random stimuli during simulation.
    * Hardware Description Languages (HDL) like Verilog and VHDL describe hardware behavior so it can be converted into digital circuits.

2. Why Verilog is not preferred:
    * Verilog was designed in the 1990s for small and simple designs.
    * It lacks modern features needed for complex verification tasks.
    * SystemVerilog advantages:
        . Constrained random stimulus generation.
        . OOP-based testbench construction.
        . Functional coverage and assertions.
        . Scalable and structured verification flow.

3. Verification:
    * Verification ensures that a hardware design works as intended.
    * Catching bugs early saves time, cost, and resources.
    * Late-found bugs may require a respin of the chip, redoing multiple design steps.
