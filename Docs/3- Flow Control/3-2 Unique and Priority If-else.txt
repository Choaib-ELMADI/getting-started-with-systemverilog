1. Introduction to Conditional Constructs:
    * SystemVerilog provides enhanced conditional statements like "unique", "unique0", and "priority".
    * These constructs help detect coding issues such as overlapping or missing condition matches.
    * Syntax Example:
        > unique if (condition)
        > unique0 if (condition)
        > priority if (condition)

2. unique-if:
    * Evaluates conditions in any order.
    * Reports an error when "no condition matches" and "no else block" exists.
    * Reports an error when "multiple conditions match".
    * Ensures mutual exclusivity and complete coverage.
    * Syntax Example:
        > unique if (condition1)
        >   statement1;
        > else if (condition2)
        >   statement2;
        > else
        >   statement3;

3. unique0-if:
    * Similar to "unique-if" but does not report a violation when "no condition matches".
    * Useful when none of the conditions might be true under certain cases.
    * Syntax Example:
        > unique0 if (condition1)
        >   statement1;
        > else if (condition2)
        >   statement2;

4. priority-if:
    * Evaluates conditions sequentially (top to bottom).
    * Reports an error when "none of the conditions match" and "no else clause" exists.
    * Execution stops after the "first true condition" (no parallel evaluation).
    * Syntax Example:
        > priority if (condition1)
        >   statement1;
        > else if (condition2)
        >   statement2;
        > else
        >   statement3;

5. Key Differences Between unique-if and priority-if:
    * "unique-if" checks for multiple true conditions (mutual exclusivity).
    * "priority-if" checks for missing else conditions (completeness).
