1. Introduction to Loops:
    * A loop is a block of code that executes repeatedly.
    * Loops usually include a condition to terminate execution.
    * If the loop has no terminating condition, simulation may hang indefinitely.

2. Forever Loop:
    * Executes continuously without stopping.
    * Must include a time delay or simulation control to prevent hanging.
    * Syntax Example:
        > forever begin
        > end

3. Repeat Loop:
    * Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
    * Syntax Example:
        > repeat (5) begin
        > end

4. While Loop:
    * Executes a block repeatedly while a condition is true.
    * Condition is evaluated before each iteration.
    * Syntax Example:
        > while (counter < 10) begin
        >   @(posedge clk);
        >   counter++;
        > end

5. For Loop:
    * Combines initialization, condition, and increment in one line.
    * Often used as a condensed form of a while loop.
    * Syntax Example:
        > for (counter = 2; counter < 14; counter = counter + 2) begin
        >   @(posedge clk);
        > end

6. Do-While Loop:
    * Executes the block first, then checks the condition.
    * Ensures the block runs at least once.
    * Syntax Example:
        > do begin
        >   @(posedge clk);
        >   counter++;
        > end while (counter < 5);

7. Foreach Loop:
    * Designed to iterate through all elements of an array.
    * No need to manually manage indices or array size.
    * Syntax Example:
        > foreach (array[index]) begin
        >   array[index] = index;
        > end
