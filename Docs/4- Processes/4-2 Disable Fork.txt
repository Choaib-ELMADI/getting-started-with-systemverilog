1. Introduction to "disable fork":
    * Used to terminate all active threads that were spawned using a "fork...join" construct.
    * Helps in stopping background or long-running threads when they're no longer needed.
    * Useful for avoiding unnecessary simulation activity.

2. Why disable a fork?
    * When a "fork...join_any" block finishes, the remaining threads continue to run.
    * Sometimes these remaining threads are no longer needed, so "disable fork" is used to stop them.
