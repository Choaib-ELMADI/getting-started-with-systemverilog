1. Mailbox:
    * A mailbox in SystemVerilog is a communication mechanism used for message passing between different processes or threads.
    * Commonly used in testbenches to transfer data between generators, drivers, monitors, and scoreboards safely.
    * Operates as a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer, messages are sent and received in order.
    * Supports thread synchronization, the receiver waits if the mailbox is empty.

    * Blocking and Non-blocking Methods:
        . put(): Puts a message into the mailbox.
        . get(): Blocking method; waits until a message is available.
        . try_get(): Non-blocking method; returns immediately if no message is available.
        . num(): Returns the number of messages currently stored in the mailbox.

    * Syntax examples:
        > mailbox gen2drv;      // mailbox between generator and driver
        > gen2drv.put(trans);   // put transaction into mailbox
        > gen2drv.get(trans);   // blocking get() call
